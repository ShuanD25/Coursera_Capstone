    "Using the request and beutifulsoup4 libraries, we can web scrape the neighborhoods, or communities, from Wikipedia and then use the FourSquare API to give us the stores that are opened in that area to help figure out the best location to start the restaurant. Using the Machine Learning method of K-Mean clustering we can figure out which community does not have too much competition and then check if the area is safe using heat map on the crime rates in that neighborhood. The solutions that this project offers are only for advising purposes and in the end the decision is up to the one who is making the investment. "
