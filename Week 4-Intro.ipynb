    "Opening a new business is a very risky investment, especially when it comes to opening a new restaurant. Studies have shown that in the first year of a newly opened restaurant around 26% of them fails follow by 19% in the second and 14% in the third year. This means it is very important that you build your restaurant's business on a solid foundation, in other words, choosing a good location. Location is by far one of the most important factor in playing the success of a restaurant. Having a good menu and good staff is important to a restaurant's success, but having a good location is another key point that you can't overlook. While choosing a location on a little-traveled side street or back road might save you on rent, but as a consequence your business would not be very visible. Setting up shop near an area with a lot of vehicle traffic and foot traffic puts your name out to a lot more people and offers you the opportunity for a lot more cheap marketing. When choosing a location there are several important factors that you must consider such as the competition around you and if the neighborhood is safe. There are a lot more factors to consider when choosing the location, but for the sake of this project we will be only looking at these 2 factors. Suppose you're looking to open a Chinese restaurant in Chicago, Illinois, USA and is not sure where to open it. Thus, the business question here will be, \"In which neighborhoods in Chicago should I consider to look into for a space to open a Chinese restaurant?\""
